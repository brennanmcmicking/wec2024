# Calendar

Welcome to Calendar! This app is a one-stop-shop for planning your day in a manageable way. There are two things that we do:

* Track calendar events
* Plan when you do your tasks

We understand that it can be tough to plan your day without feeling overwhelmed. The calendar's real super-power is how these features work together: when you add tasks to your list, it schedules them on your calendar when you have time. This takes most of the work out of planning your day: just record your tasks, and the calendar will take care of when to do what.

## Features

On the calendar page, you can view your events for the entire week at once. Feel free to add events by clicking the black button at the top of the page. If you would like to cancel the operation, click the X button in the top right, click out of the modal, or press the escape key on your keyboard.

On the tasks page, we have not yet added the ability to add tasks. You can nagivate there from the top of the page.
